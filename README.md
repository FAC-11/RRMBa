## **WHY (our purpose)**


How many times you would have wished you knew the status of the tube line you were going to take? Maybe if you had known you would have felt that annoyed, frustrated or content you would have changed your route!

We felt it was useful to display the information about the status of the tubes lines as well as illustrating how you would feel after taking them.


## **WHAT**


In our website, when clicking on the tube line that you will be using, the information regarding the status of the line will be displayed as well as an image indicating you how you would feel after using it.

### File Structure
--------
We decided to divide our code in 4 folders:

* HTML
* CSS
* Logic - where our pure functions (logic.js), tests (logic.test.js) and Dom.js will be  written.
* Dom
* Ressources
* ReadMe

There was a initial discussion about creating another file inside logic called API.js where our not-pure functions will be written. That would allow us to have 100 % test coverage and have all the pure functions together. However, to make the code more readable, we decided not to take this approach.
